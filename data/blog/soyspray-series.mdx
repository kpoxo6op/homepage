summary: 'My journey of setting up home cluster on miniPCs.'
---

Announcing a series of blog posts about setting up a home cluster on miniPCs.

Here is my best attempt to summarize the journey so far:

- [Motivation](/blog/soyspray/motivation)
- [Choosing hardware](/blog/soyspray/choosing-hardware)
- [Choosing software](/blog/soyspray/choosing-software)
- Installing the OS
- Bootstrapping the cluster
- Configuring the cluster
- Deploying the applications
- Alerting


I will start covering these topics based on the plan and will update the plan as I go.
