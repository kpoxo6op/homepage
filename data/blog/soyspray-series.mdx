summary: 'My journey of setting up home cluster on miniPCs.'
---

Announcing a series of blog posts about setting up a home cluster on miniPCs.

Here is my best attempt to summarize the journey so far:

- Motivation
- Choosing hardware
- Choosing software
- Installing the OS
- Bootstrapping the cluster
- Configuring the cluster
- Deploying the applications

I will start covering these topics based on the plan and will update the plan as I go.

{/* motivation. the majority of search results is hello world.
