Before I even seriously started thinking how to install Kubernetes at home, I
already knew that I wanted to use Kubespray. This short post is just to explain
how I made that decision and why I think Kubespray is a good start.

If you search internet for how to set up a **full featured** Kubernetes cluster at home, almost immediately you find two products: [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) and [Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray). In most cases, people will pick between these two if they are seriously setting up something.

I really liked Talos Linux. It's clean, elegant, secure, and has a beautifully designed architecture. But I quickly realized it wasn't a good match for my needs. The core philosophy of Talos Linux is that the only thing running on your machines should be Kubernetes. You can't even SSH into it; installing or running other software simply isn't allowed. That's perfectly fine if your goal is solely to operate Kubernetes and Kubernetes-native applications. However, in my situation, I also want to run additional tools like WireGuard, maybe a Tailscale relay node, and other software that doesn't fit neatly into Kubernetes.

So I want to have a normal operating system that can run Kubernetes and also
something else. That's why Talos OS, even if it's beautiful and secure and well
made, is not a good match for me.

Then I looked at Kubespray. Kubespray seemed appealing because it's an official Kubernetes project, fully open source, has over 15,000 stars on GitHub, and has been around for many years. But the main thing that drew me to Kubespray was its simplicity and flexibility. It doesn't require anything special - just any popular Linux distribution with SSH access and a user that can sudo without a password. That's it. Whether you have one machine or a hundred, Kubespray will install Kubernetes for you using Ansible. Ansible itself was another significant advantage, as I knew I could reuse it to manage tasks beyond Kubernetes, such as installing helpful utilities on my nodes.

I initially thought Kubespray would be a good choice, so I started researching by reviewing the official documentation, GitHub repository, YouTube videos, and other resources. While doing this, I realized something important, which became the main reason for writing this blog post.

The Kubespray documentation is a bit messy and outdated. It lacks a proper quickstart guide and isn't beginner-friendly. If you're already familiar with Kubespray, the documentation might be fine, but it’s difficult for newcomers.

Another issue is that most YouTube videos only show basic setups. Typically, they install Kubespray on three virtual machines, run a simple command like `kubectl get pods`, and then stop there. They rarely demonstrate realistic workloads or interesting practical use cases.

However, I found one genuinely helpful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJoK8MMI23Q) from a creator named Farhad. He installed Kubespray on VirtualBox, clearly showed his terminal, addressed real issues openly, and eventually got everything working. That video significantly boosted my confidence in using Kubespray.

Inspired by Farhad’s approach, I decided to clearly document my entire experience. My goal is to make installing and configuring Kubespray easier and more accessible for anyone who wants to set up their own Kubernetes cluster.
