Before I even seriously started thinking how to install Kubernetes at home, I
already knew that I wanted to use Kubespray. This short post is just to explain
how I made that decision and why I think Kubespray is a good start.

If you search internet for how to set up a **full featured** Kubernetes cluster
at home, almost immediately you find two products: [Talos
Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) and
[Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray). In most cases, people
will pick between these two if they are seriously setting up something.

### Talos Linux

I really liked Talos Linux. It's clean, elegant, secure, and has a beautifully
designed architecture. But I quickly realized it wasn't a good match for my
needs. The core philosophy of Talos Linux is that the only thing running on your
machines should be Kubernetes. You can't even SSH into it; installing or running
other software simply isn't allowed. That's perfectly fine if your goal is
solely to operate Kubernetes and Kubernetes-native applications. However, in my
situation, I also want to run additional tools like WireGuard, maybe a Tailscale
relay node, and other software that doesn't fit neatly into Kubernetes.

So I want to have a normal operating system that can run Kubernetes and also
something else. That's why Talos OS, even if it's beautiful and secure and well
made, is not a good match for me.

### Kubespray

Kubespray appealed to me because it's an official Kubernetes project, has over
15,000 stars on GitHub, and has been around for many years. The killer feature,
though, is its simplicity and flexibility: give it any popular Linux
distribution with SSH access and a sudo-without-password user, and it will
bootstrap Kubernetes for one node or a hundred using Ansible. Because Kubespray
itself uses Ansible, I can reuse the same approach to automate other node tasks
if I decide to.
