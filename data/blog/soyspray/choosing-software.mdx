Before I even seriously started thinking how to install Kubernetes at home, I
already knew that I wanted to use Kubespray. This short post is just to explain
how I made that decision and why I think Kubespray is a good start.

If you search internet for how to set up a **full featured** Kubernetes cluster at home, almost immediately you find two products: [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) and [Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray). In most cases, people will pick between these two if they are seriously setting up something.

I really liked Talos Linux. It's clean, elegant, secure, and has a beautifully designed architecture. But I quickly realized it wasn't a good match for my needs. The core philosophy of Talos Linux is that the only thing running on your machines should be Kubernetes. You can't even SSH into it; installing or running other software simply isn't allowed. That's perfectly fine if your goal is solely to operate Kubernetes and Kubernetes-native applications. However, in my situation, I also want to run additional tools like WireGuard, maybe a Tailscale relay node, and other software that doesn't fit neatly into Kubernetes.

So I want to have a normal operating system that can run Kubernetes and also
something else. That's why Talos OS, even if it's beautiful and secure and well
made, is not a good match for me.

Then I looked at Kubespray. Kubespray seemed appealing because it's an official Kubernetes project, fully open source, has over 15,000 stars on GitHub, and has been around for many years. But the main thing that drew me to Kubespray was its simplicity and flexibility. It doesn't require anything special - just any popular Linux distribution with SSH access and a user that can sudo without a password. That's it. Whether you have one machine or a hundred, Kubespray will install Kubernetes for you using Ansible. Ansible itself was another significant advantage, as I knew I could reuse it to manage tasks beyond Kubernetes, such as installing helpful utilities on my nodes.

Initially, Kubespray seemed like a very good choice, so I began checking the official documentation, GitHub repository, YouTube videos, and other online resources. While doing this research, I realized a few important issues.

First of all, the official Kubespray documentation is somewhat messy and outdated. It doesn’t have a clear quickstart guide and isn't friendly for beginners. If you're already familiar with Kubespray, it might be fine, but for someone new, it's not very helpful.

The second issue I found is that most YouTube videos about Kubespray show only very basic setups. They usually install Kubespray on a few virtual machines, run one simple command like `kubectl get pods`, and then they stop there. They don't show realistic examples or interesting practical use cases.

But I did find one really useful [video from Farhad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJoK8MMI23Q). He installed Kubespray on VirtualBox, clearly showed the terminal output, handled real issues openly, and eventually got everything working. Seeing this video really boosted my confidence to use Kubespray.

Inspired by Farhad’s approach, I decided to clearly document my own Kubespray experience. My plan is to show more realistic use cases and easy-to-follow examples. I will integrate Kubespray as a git submodule, use my own additional Ansible playbooks, show how to do upgrades, and demonstrate other day-two operations. My goal is to make installing and managing Kubernetes clusters at home easier and clearer for everyone.
