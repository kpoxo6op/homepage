# Motivation

## Beyond Hello World

After diving into countless Kubespray tutorials, I noticed they all stopped at
the "Hello World" stage.

There's a real gap in resources showing how to build something practical with
Kubespray - like setting up a proper home lab.

## Blocking Ads

My son was getting frustrated with YouTube ads, so I wanted to see if I could
block them at the router level, even in the iPhone app. I've heard about Pi-hole
and thought this would be a good chance to try it.

(AND IT DID NOT WORK!!!)

## A Case for 3D Printing

I've been looking for a meaningful 3D printing project, not just decorative
figurines.

A custom case for my cluster seemed like a perfect practical project.

## Learning Kubernetes

At work, we have a dedicated team managing Kubernetes clusters.

I wanted to understand what's happening under the hood, so building my own
cluster seemed like a good way to learn.
